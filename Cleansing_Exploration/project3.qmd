## QUESTION 1

__What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length?__ Describe the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month.

I used a variable i calculated delay_ratio by dividing total delays by total flights and then grouping by month and getting the average of each airport. With this I was able to create a graph that shows September is the optimal month to fly.

```{python}
# replace missing values to np.nan to easier be dealt with
missing_values = ["", 'n/a', -999]
df = df.replace(missing_values, np.nan)
df['month'] = df['month'].ffill()

# create new delay ratio column to be used to find month with least chance of a delay of any length happening
df['delay_ratio'] = df['num_of_delays_total'] / df['num_of_flights_total']

# group by month
info = df.groupby('month').agg(
  delay_ratio = ('delay_ratio', 'mean')
).reset_index()

# fix missspelling of february
info['month'] = info['month'].replace('Febuary', 'February')

# orders months correctly
month_order = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June',
               'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']

info['month'] = pd.Categorical(info['month'], categories=month_order, ordered=True)

info

(
  ggplot(info, aes(x='month', y='delay_ratio')) 
  + geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='grey', color='black')
  + ylab("Delay Rate")
  + theme_classic()
)

```
