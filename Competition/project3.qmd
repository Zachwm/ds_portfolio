## QUESTION 1

__Calculate the average career length for players who have played at least 10 games in their career. Use years as the unit of measure.__

Here the table is formated so you are able ot see the the average career length is 6.8 years.

```{python}
q = '''
SELECT ROUND(AVG(career_length), 3) AS `Average career length`
  FROM (
    SELECT
      playerID,
      (MAX(yearID) - MIN(yearID) + 1) AS career_length
    FROM appearances
    GROUP BY playerID
    HAVING SUM(G_all) >= 10
)
'''
results = pd.read_sql_query(q, con)
results
```


## QUESTION 2

1. Identify the top 10 players with the longest careers (based on the number of years they played). Include their:

    - playerID
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - career_length

This is a table showing the players that have the largest span of time between the first game and their final game not showing players with the most seasons played.

```{python}
q = '''
    SELECT
      playerID,
      nameFirst,
      nameLast,
      ROUND((julianday(finalGame) - julianday(debut) + 1) / 365.25, 3) AS   career_length_years
    FROM people
    ORDER BY career_length_years DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    '''
results = pd.read_sql_query(q, con)
results
```
